# VTS-Mission
This is a Repo for bringing the VTS Mission by l'etranger to a more stable state with the current Arma 3 Game -Version.

License:
As l'etranger states in the BI-Forums

 "You may edit the .PBO mission content to your need and taste, but you may not use any VTS system outside the the VTS mission without written permission."
 - So this is an attempt to "edit" the "mission content to your need and taste" within the "VTS system"


 # Original Readme:

 Hey,
 If you are too lazy to copy and rename the mission for the needed islands, just run the "vts_for_all_a3_islands" batch.
 It will do the job for you.

 Have fun

 VTS by L'etranger, from Gonza and Grimm's original work.
